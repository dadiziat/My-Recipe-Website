## Simple Learning Practice 

## Mission
- To apply HTML CSS concepts towards practice.
- Enhance Problem Solving skills.

## Take Away 
- I Spent nearly 4 Hours from reading the 1st instruction to deploying the website.
- In those 4 hours, I struggled, and I was happy to find all the solutions needed to my strugles through effective web research, I learnt a lot and knowledge has stregthen in my brain.
- Need to Practice more for an entire week before moving to JS.
- Still having difficulities handling Responsive Design, but I managed to solve the problem, at the end of the day, I SOLVED the PROBLEM. 
- I will use git Bash inside my VS Code to push my code to gitHub, still newbie, good to practice GIT & GitHub. 

## Comments for Me to Reflect 
- HTML is simple to learn compared to CSS, but a good well organized HTML skeleton will ease the path for CSS.
- I have well command with Emmet abbrevation, learnt that heavily, and everyday I use Emmet to speed up my workflow when writing HTML. 
- I tried, and will try in future to menemise using classes, I also do my best to use semantic HTML and target tag elements more than classes, I also used Pseudo classes and Pseudo Elements heavily on purpose to stick them on my mind, my favorite one is :nth-of-type()

- li::marker will allow you to style the bullets points of the OL/UL lists. 
- Thank you for following my work and following me through my learning process. 
- Side Note: I would never thought I would finish this project, a miracle, persistance, consentency, and problem solving will finish the work. DO NOT GIVE UP. I AM WILLING TO LEARN FOREVER.
